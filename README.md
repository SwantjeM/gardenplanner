# Garden Planner

This project is a garden planner used to keep track of your seed inventory, planting dates, plant information and more. 
It also is a work in progress.




Some of the initial commits, before I migrated the project here for easier deployment, can be found [here](https://github.com/SwantjeM/garden-planner).
